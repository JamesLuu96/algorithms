// given an string, return true if the string is a "true number"
// a number is a true number if each index in the number is 
// the count of how many times that current index appears in 
// the number.

// ex. "2020" is a true number because... 
// "2 _ _ _" there are two 0's in "2020"
// "_ 0 _ _" there are zero 1's in "2020"
// "_ _ 2 _" there are two 2's in "2020"
// "_ _ _ 0" there are zero 3's in "2020"
